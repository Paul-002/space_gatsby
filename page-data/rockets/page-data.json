In November 2018 the second stage and ship was renamed by CEO Elon Musk to Starship, while the first stage was given the moniker <strong>\"Super Heavy.\"</strong> The overall space vehicle architecture includes both launch vehicle and spacecraft, as well as ground infrastructure for rapid launch and relaunch, and propellant transfer in space.
