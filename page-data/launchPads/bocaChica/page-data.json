Also during this period, SpaceX began acquiring land in the area, purchasing approximately 41 acres (17 ha) and leasing 57 acres (23 ha) by July 2014. SpaceX announced in August 2014, that they had selected the location near Brownsville as the location for the new non-governmental launch site,<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_South_Texas_Launch_Site#cite_note-hc20140804-10\">[10]</a> after the final environmental assessment completed and environmental agreements were in place by July 2014.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_South_Texas_Launch_Site#cite_note-bbbw20140711-11\">[11]</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_South_Texas_Launch_Site#cite_note-sn20140711-12\">[12]</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_South_Texas_Launch_Site#cite_note-bh20140729-13\">[13]</a> When completed, it will become SpaceX's fourth active launch facility, following three launch locations that are leased from the US government.</p>\n<p>SpaceX conducted a groundbreaking ceremony on the new launch facility in September 2014,<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_South_Texas_Launch_Site#cite_note-bh20140922-14\">[14]</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_South_Texas_Launch_Site#cite_note-sn20140922-1\">[1]</a> and soil preparation began in October 2015.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_South_Texas_Launch_Site#cite_note-vmn20151022-15\">[15]</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_South_Texas_Launch_Site#cite_note-krgv20160118-16\">[16]</a> The first tracking antenna was installed in August 2016, and the first propellant tank arrived in July 2018.
