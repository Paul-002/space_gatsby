It consisted of two launch pads, <strong>SLC-4W</strong> and <strong>SLC-4E</strong>, which were formerly designated <strong>PALC2-3</strong> and <strong>PALC2-4</strong> respectively. Both pads were built for use by Atlas-Agena rockets, but were later rebuilt to handle Titan rockets. The designation SLC-4 was applied at the time of the conversion to launch Titans.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandenberg_AFB_Space_Launch_Complex_4#cite_note-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">[1]</a></p>\n<p>Both pads at Space Launch Complex 4 are currently leased by SpaceX. SLC-4E is leased as a launch site for the Falcon 9 rocket, which first flew from Vandenberg on 29 September 2013, following a 24-month refurbishment program which had started in early 2011.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandenberg_AFB_Space_Launch_Complex_4#cite_note-ScullyJ-2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">[2]</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandenberg_AFB_Space_Launch_Complex_4#cite_note-SpaceX-Updates-3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">[3]</a> SpaceX began a five-year lease of Launch Complex 4 West in February 2015 in order to use that area as a landing pad to bring back VTVL Return-To-Launch-Site (RTLS) first-stage boosters of the reusable Falcon 9 launch vehicle. That pad was later named by SpaceX as Landing Zone 4 and first used operationally for a Falcon 9 booster landing in 2018.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Vandenberg Base SLC-4","type":"launchPad"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/launchPads/vandenberg/"}}}
