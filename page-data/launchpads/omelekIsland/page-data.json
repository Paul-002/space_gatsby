SLC-3W was modified by SpaceX to support the Falcon 1, and the Falcon 1 was erected on the pad in 2005. Problems arose when SpaceX was unable to obtain sufficient launch window availability because the pad would overfly other Air Force pads that were frequently left occupied for weeks or months at a time, thus severely restricting SpaceX launches.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_launch_facilities#cite_note-ind20110715-25\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">[25]</a> Ultimately, this launch pad was never used for orbital launch, although it was used for a number of ground tests.</p>\n<p>SpaceX proceeded to then build a launch facility in the northern Pacific Ocean at the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site, on Omelek Island, a part of the Kwajalein Atoll, Marshall Islands. SpaceX began launching Falcon 1 rockets from Omelek in 2006. Falcon 1 Flight 4 was the first successful privately funded, liquid-propelled launch vehicle to achieve orbit, and was launched from Omelek Island on 28 September 2008, followed by another Falcon 1 launch on 13 July 2009, placing RazakSAT into orbit.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_launch_facilities#cite_note-41\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">[41]</a></p>\n<p>SpaceX originally planned to upgrade the Omelek launch site for use by the Falcon 9 launch vehicle, but later cancelled their plans to do so, and have since disassembled the entire installation. In December 2010, the SpaceX launch manifest listed Omelek (Kwajalein) as a potential site for several Falcon 9 launches, the first planned for as early as 2012.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_launch_facilities#cite_note-SpaceX_Launch_Manifest-42\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">[42]</a> The \"Falcon 9 Overview\" document also offered Kwajalein as a launch option in 2010.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_launch_facilities#cite_note-SxLaunchCost20101206-43\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">[43]</a> Since then, the FAA Environmental Impact Report of May 2014 lists this site as non-operational and returned to its original state, to no longer be used, \"Five Falcon 1 launches occurred at Omelek Island, Kwajalein Atoll. After these launches of the Falcon 1, the site was no longer needed and SpaceX closed the site and returned the property to pre-launch conditions\".<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_launch_facilities#cite_note-faaenvironmentalreport-44\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">[44]</a> All Falcon 1 launches took place at this location, five launches from 2006 to 2009. SpaceX abandoned Omelek when Falcon 1 was retired, due to the expense of logistics.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Omelek Island","type":"launchPad"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/launchpads/omelekIsland/"}}}
