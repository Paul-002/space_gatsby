One potential shared user in the Blue Origin notional plan was with United Launch Alliance.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_launch_facilities#cite_note-os20130818-15\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">[15]</a> In September 2013—prior to completion of the bid period, and prior to any public announcement by NASA of the results of the process—Blue Origin filed a protest with the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) over what it said was \"a plan by NASA to award an exclusive commercial lease to SpaceX for use of mothballed space shuttle launch LC-39A.\"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_launch_facilities#cite_note-pa20130910-18\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">[18]</a> NASA planned to complete the bid award and have the pad transferred by October 1, 2013, but the protest delayed a decision until after the GAO resolved the protest.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_launch_facilities#cite_note-pa20130910-18\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">[18]</a> Following the eruption of the controversy, on September 21, SpaceX said that they were willing to support a multi-user arrangement for LC-39A.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_launch_facilities#cite_note-sp20130921-16\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">[16]</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_launch_facilities#cite_note-sfn20131018-2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">[2]</a> In December 2013, the GAO denied the protest and sided with NASA, which argued that the solicitation contains no preference on the use of the facility as multi-use or single-use. \"The solicitation document merely asks bidders to explain their reasons for selecting one approach instead of the other and how they would manage the facility.\"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_launch_facilities#cite_note-pa20131212-19\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">[19]</a></p>\n<p>SpaceX began architectural and engineering design work on the pad modifications in 2013, and signed the contractual documents to lease the pad for 20 years<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_launch_facilities#cite_note-ft20140415-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">[20]</a> from NASA in April 2014.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_launch_facilities#cite_note-cs20140414-21\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">[21]</a> SpaceX is building a large Horizontal Integration Facility (HIF) just outside the perimeter of the existing launch pad in order to \"house the Falcon rockets and associated hardware and payloads during processing.\"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_launch_facilities#cite_note-nsf20141117-22\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">[22]</a> This is a marked difference from the vertical integration facility used by previous US government rockets that used the launch pad (Apollo Program and the Space Shuttle)—plus the installation of all new instrumentation and control systems, with substantial new plumbing for a variety of rocket liquids and gasses.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_launch_facilities#cite_note-ft20140415-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">[20]</a></p>\n<p>The Falcon rockets will be transported from the HIF to the launch pad aboard a Transporter Erector (TE) which will ride on rails up the former crawlerway path.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_launch_facilities#cite_note-nsf20141117-22\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">[22]</a> In February 2016, it was reported that the pad was completed and activated indicating it is ready for launches of Falcon 9 Full Thrust.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_launch_facilities#cite_note-23\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">[23]</a> The first SpaceX launch from LC-39A occurred in February 2017, followed by a successful first-stage landing at Landing Zone 1.
