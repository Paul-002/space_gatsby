Falcon 1 Flight 4 was the first successful privately funded, liquid-propelled launch vehicle to achieve orbit, and was launched from Omelek Island on 28 September 2008, followed by another Falcon 1 launch on 13 July 2009, placing RazakSAT into orbit.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_launch_facilities#cite_note-41" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">[41]</a></p>\n<p>SpaceX originally planned to upgrade the Omelek launch site for use by the Falcon 9 launch vehicle, but later cancelled their plans to do so, and have since disassembled the entire installation. In December 2010, the SpaceX launch manifest listed Omelek (Kwajalein) as a potential site for several Falcon 9 launches, the first planned for as early as 2012.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_launch_facilities#cite_note-SpaceX_Launch_Manifest-42" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">[42]</a> The "Falcon 9 Overview" document also offered Kwajalein as a launch option in 2010.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_launch_facilities#cite_note-SxLaunchCost20101206-43" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">[43]</a> Since then, the FAA Environmental Impact Report of May 2014 lists this site as non-operational and returned to its original state, to no longer be used, "Five Falcon 1 launches occurred at Omelek Island, Kwajalein Atoll. After these launches of the Falcon 1, the site was no longer needed and SpaceX closed the site and returned the property to pre-launch conditions".<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_launch_facilities#cite_note-faaenvironmentalreport-44" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">[44]</a> All Falcon 1 launches took place at this location, five launches from 2006 to 2009.
