The Falcon Heavy is a partially reusable heavy-lift launch vehicle designed and manufactured by SpaceX. It is derived from the Falcon 9 vehicle and consists of a strengthened Falcon 9 first stage as the center core with two additional first stages as strap-on boosters.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_Heavy#cite_note-sxf9o20100508-8) The Falcon Heavy has the highest payload capacity of any currently operational launch vehicle, the second-highest capacity of any rocket ever to reach orbit, trailing the Saturn V, and the third-highest capacity of any orbital-class rocket ever launched (behind the Saturn V and Energia).

SpaceX conducted the Falcon Heavy's maiden launch on February 6, 2018, at 3:45 p.m. EST (20:45 UTC).[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_Heavy#cite_note-cbs-harwood-4) The rocket carried a Tesla Roadster belonging to SpaceX founder Elon Musk, as a dummy payload.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_Heavy#cite_note-bbc-9) The second Falcon Heavy launch occurred on April 11, 2019 and all three booster rockets successfully returned to earth.[[10]]()

The Falcon Heavy was designed to carry humans into space beyond low Earth orbit, although as of February 2018, Musk does not plan to apply for a human-rating certification to carry NASA astronauts.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_Heavy#cite_note-wsj-11) The Falcon Heavy and Falcon 9 will be replaced by the Starship and Super Heavy launch system.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_Heavy#cite_note-sn20170929-12)
