The Falcon 1 was an expendable launch system privately developed and manufactured by SpaceX during 2006–2009.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_1#cite_note-st20130301-3) On 28 September 2008, Falcon 1 became the first privately-developed liquid-fuel launch vehicle to go into orbit around the Earth.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_1#cite_note-vance2015-4)

The two-stage-to-orbit rocket used LOX/RP-1 for both stages, the first powered by a single Merlin engine and the second powered by a single Kestrel engine. It was designed by SpaceX from the ground up.

The vehicle was launched a total of five times. Falcon 1 achieved orbit on its fourth attempt, in September 2008 with a mass simulator as a payload. On 14 July 2009, Falcon 1 made its final flight and successfully delivered the Malaysian RazakSAT satellite to orbit on SpaceX's first commercial launch (fifth launch overall). Following its fifth launch, the Falcon 1 was retired and succeeded by Falcon 9.

SpaceX had announced an enhanced variant, the Falcon 1e[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_1#cite_note-F1-retired-2), but development was stopped in favor of Falcon 9.
