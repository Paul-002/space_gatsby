**Space Launch Complex 4** (**SLC-4**) is a launch and landing site at Vandenberg Air Force Base with two pads, both of which are used by SpaceX for Falcon 9 launch operations, operating as **Landing Zone 4** (**LZ-4**) for SpaceX landings.

The complex was previously used by Atlas and Titan rockets between 1963 and 2005. It consisted of two launch pads, **SLC-4W** and **SLC-4E**, which were formerly designated **PALC2-3** and **PALC2-4** respectively. Both pads were built for use by Atlas-Agena rockets, but were later rebuilt to handle Titan rockets. The designation SLC-4 was applied at the time of the conversion to launch Titans.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandenberg_AFB_Space_Launch_Complex_4#cite_note-1)

Both pads at Space Launch Complex 4 are currently leased by SpaceX. SLC-4E is leased as a launch site for the Falcon 9 rocket, which first flew from Vandenberg on 29 September 2013, following a 24-month refurbishment program which had started in early 2011.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandenberg_AFB_Space_Launch_Complex_4#cite_note-ScullyJ-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandenberg_AFB_Space_Launch_Complex_4#cite_note-SpaceX-Updates-3) SpaceX began a five-year lease of Launch Complex 4 West in February 2015 in order to use that area as a landing pad to bring back VTVL Return-To-Launch-Site (RTLS) first-stage boosters of the reusable Falcon 9 launch vehicle. That pad was later named by SpaceX as Landing Zone 4 and first used operationally for a Falcon 9 booster landing in 2018.
