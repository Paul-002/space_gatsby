The **SpaceX South Texas Launch Site** is a spaceport and test site being built at **Boca Chica Village** near Brownsville, Texas, for the private use of Space Exploration Technologies Corporation (SpaceX).[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_South_Texas_Launch_Site#cite_note-spacex_about-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_South_Texas_Launch_Site#cite_note-msa20140804-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_South_Texas_Launch_Site#cite_note-shotwell201503317-6) Its stated purpose is "to provide SpaceX an exclusive launch site that would allow the company to accommodate its launch manifest and meet tight launch windows."[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_South_Texas_Launch_Site#cite_note-faa201304v1-7) The launch site was originally intended to support launches of the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launch vehicles as well as "a variety of reusable suborbital launch vehicles",[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_South_Texas_Launch_Site#cite_note-faa201304v1-7) but in 2018, SpaceX announced a change of plans, stating that the site would be used exclusively for BFR.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_South_Texas_Launch_Site#cite_note-201805pressConference-8) SpaceX CEO Elon Musk indicated in 2014 that he expected "commercial astronauts, private astronauts, to be departing from South Texas,"[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_South_Texas_Launch_Site#cite_note-sn20140922-1) and he foresaw launching spacecraft to Mars from there.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_South_Texas_Launch_Site#cite_note-bh20140927-9)

Between 2012 and 2014, SpaceX considered seven potential locations around the United States for the new commercial launch pad. For much of this period, a parcel of land adjacent to Boca Chica Beach near Brownsville, Texas was the leading candidate location, during an extended period while the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) conducted an extensive environmental assessment on the use of the Texas location as a launch site. Also during this period, SpaceX began acquiring land in the area, purchasing approximately 41 acres (17 ha) and leasing 57 acres (23 ha) by July 2014. SpaceX announced in August 2014, that they had selected the location near Brownsville as the location for the new non-governmental launch site,[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_South_Texas_Launch_Site#cite_note-hc20140804-10) after the final environmental assessment completed and environmental agreements were in place by July 2014.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_South_Texas_Launch_Site#cite_note-bbbw20140711-11)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_South_Texas_Launch_Site#cite_note-sn20140711-12)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_South_Texas_Launch_Site#cite_note-bh20140729-13) When completed, it will become SpaceX's fourth active launch facility, following three launch locations that are leased from the US government.

SpaceX conducted a groundbreaking ceremony on the new launch facility in September 2014,[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_South_Texas_Launch_Site#cite_note-bh20140922-14)[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_South_Texas_Launch_Site#cite_note-sn20140922-1) and soil preparation began in October 2015.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_South_Texas_Launch_Site#cite_note-vmn20151022-15)[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_South_Texas_Launch_Site#cite_note-krgv20160118-16) The first tracking antenna was installed in August 2016, and the first propellant tank arrived in July 2018. In late 2018, construction ramped up considerably, and the site saw the fabrication of a Starship test article, which was first flown in April 2019.
