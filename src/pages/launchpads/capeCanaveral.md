In 2007, the US Air Force leased Cape Canaveral SLC-40 to SpaceX to launch the Falcon 9 rocket.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_launch_facilities#cite_note-FloridaToday-8) During April 2008, construction started on the ground facilities necessary to support the launch of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. Renovations included installation of new liquid oxygen and kerosene tanks and construction of a hangar for rocket and payload preparation.

The first Falcon 9 rocket arrived at SLC-40 in late 2008, and was first erected on January 10, 2009.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_launch_facilities#cite_note-9) It successfully reached orbit on its maiden launch on June 4, 2010, carrying a dummy payload qualification unit. SpaceX modified the launch pad in 2013 in order to support launches of the Falcon 9 v1.1 launch vehicle, a 60 percent heavier rocket with 60 percent more thrust on realigned engines[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_launch_facilities#cite_note-121117SFNfalcon9commercial-10) and 60 percent longer fuel tank than the v1.0 version of the Falcon 9, requiring a modified transporter/erector.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_launch_facilities#cite_note-sn20130906-11)

In September 2016, the pad was damaged when a Falcon 9 rocket exploded during liquid oxygen loading in preparation for a hot-fire test.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_launch_facilities#cite_note-12) The pad was repaired and used for the first time since the explosion in the SpaceX CRS-13 mission in December 2017.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_launch_facilities#cite_note-13)
